 *
 * Only plain objects and arrays are made mutable. All other objects are
 * considered uncopyable.
 *
 * Note: This function is __bound__ to its `Immer` instance.
 *
 * @param {any} base - the initial state
 * @param {Function} producer - function that receives a proxy of the base state as first argument and which can be freely modified
 * @param {Function} patchListener - optional function that will be called with all the patches produced here
 * @returns {any} a new state, or the initial state if nothing was modified
